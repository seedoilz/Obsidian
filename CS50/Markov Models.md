title: Markov Models

#machinelearning

### Markov Assumption
The current state depends on only a finite fixed number of previous states.
Usingt he Markov assumption, we restrict our previous states, thereby making the task manageable. What we get from this is a more rough approxiamation of the probabilities of interest, but this is often good enough for our needs.

### Markov Chain
> A sequence of random variables where the distribution of each variable follows the Markov assumption.
> Each event in the chain occurs based on the probability of the event before it.

#### How to use?
##### A transition model
