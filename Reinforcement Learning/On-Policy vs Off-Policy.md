## On-Policy vs Off-Policy

[[Reinforcement Learning]]

On-policy: [[Sarsa]]

With Sarsa, you update the value estimates based on the policy you following directly

off-policy: [[Q-Learning]]

With Q-Learning, you still can have approximated the greedy policy even though you were choosing different actions which may have been sub-optimal
